### Chrome Extension Test

I set out to complete this test using all the languages that give bonus points in thest description. However after much deliberation I settled on using HTML, Javascript and Tailwind CSS.

I have not been exposed to chrome extensions to date so this attempt is a first for me.

## credits

A lot of googling was involved in attempting this project along with you tube tutorials. And referncing my own previous projects.

https://www.javatpoint.com/oprweb/test.jsp?filename=confirm-password-validation-in-javascript3 for form validation.

Tailwind - and associate youtube tutorials to get the css this is simliar to bootstrap so felt somewhat familiar.

Google Chrome Extension tutorials numerous on youtube and google itself.

**Current Problems**

The extension loads with no problems into chrome, however it does not run the extension.

**Anything more?**

This was an exciting challenging project and I look forward to developing my skills further.
